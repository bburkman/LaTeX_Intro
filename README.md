## Article
The Article directory contains a paper I wrote for Dr. Aminul's *Information Storage and Retrieval* course.  It's written using the template for submission to Association for Computational Linguistics articles.  It also includes using *BiBTeX* for bibliography.  

## Poster
The Poster directory contains a poster I created for DigiFest 2019 in Bossier City, LA, along with all of the supporting files.  The main input file is `DigiFest_2019_Poster.tex`, and the main output file is `DigiFest_2019_Poster.pdf.`.  All of the maps are Ti*k*Z polygons drawn from latitude/longitude coordinates contained in one of the supporting files.
