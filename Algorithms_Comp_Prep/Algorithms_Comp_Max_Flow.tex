\subsubsection{Spring 2017 \#L3}

	% S17 #L3
(Same instructions, different graph, as S15 \#S7)

	The Edmonds-Karp Algorithm (EK) follows the basic Ford-Fulkerson method with breadth-first search to choose the shortest augmenting path (in terms of the number of edges involved) for computing the maximum flow iteratively from vertex $s$ to vertex $t$ in a weighted directed graph.  Illustrate the maximum flow computation process (including the augmenting path chosen for each iteration and its resulting residual network) via EK for the graph depicted below.  
	
\
	
\hfil\begin{tikzpicture}[x=15mm, y=15mm]
	\node [circle, draw] (s) at (0,0) {$s$};
	\node [circle, draw] (v1) at (2,1) {$v_1$};
	\node [circle, draw] (v2) at (3,-1) {$v_2$};
	\node [circle, draw] (v3) at (4,1) {$v_3$};
	\node [circle, draw] (t) at (6,0) {$t$};
	\foreach \from/\to/\weight in {s/v1/16, s/v2/13, v1/v2/4, v1/v3/12, v3/v2/9, v3/t/20}
		\draw [-triangle 60] (\from) -- (\to) node [midway, circle, fill=white] {\weight};
	\path [-triangle 60] (v2) edge [bend left=10] node [midway, rectangle, fill=white] {17} (t);
	\path [triangle 60-triangle 60] (t) edge [bend left=10] node [midway, rectangle, fill=white] {8} (v2);
\end{tikzpicture}

	SHOULD THE EDGE WITH WEIGHT 8 BE BIDIRECTIONAL?  [I'm going to assume not.]
