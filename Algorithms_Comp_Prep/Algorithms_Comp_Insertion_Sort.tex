\subsection{Time Complexity}

In the worst case, the \verb|while| loop has to go the way to the bottom for every value of $j$.  This case happens when the array is sorted in decreasing order.  In that case, the recurrence is

$$T(n) = T(n-1) + cn = \Theta(n^2)$$

In the best case, for every value of $j$, $A[i] = A[j-1] \le key$, so we never engage the \verb|while| loop.  This happens when the array is already sorted in increasing order, so the time complexity is linear, $\Theta (n)$.
